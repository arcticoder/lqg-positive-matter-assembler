# GitHub About Suggestion (Conservative)

Short:
- Research-stage LQG positive matter assembler integrated with an enhanced simulation framework. Focus on validation, uncertainty quantification, and safety evaluation — not production-certified.

Long:
- This repository explores a research-stage integration of a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) positive matter assembler with an enhanced simulation hardware abstraction framework. The current status is a prototype intended for research and evaluation. Reported precision and synchronization metrics are based on internal tests and simulations and may vary with configuration and environment. Uncertainty quantification is tracked for in-scope concerns; safety and deployment require further engineering, independent validation, and certification.

Please avoid absolutist phrasing (e.g., “production-ready”, “100%”, “complete certification”). Prefer configuration-dependent and evidence-linked statements.
